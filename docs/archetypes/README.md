# The Archetypical Mind: A Comprehensive Study Guide

## Overview

The archetypical mind is Ra's term for the deep structure of consciousness designed by the Logos. Ra describes it as:

> "The archetypical mind, when penetrated lucidly, is a blueprint of the builded structure of all energy expenditures and all seeking, without distortion." (91.37)

This documentation provides a comprehensive reference for studying the 22 archetypes as taught by Ra in the Law of One material, organized to support Ra's recommended three-stage study method.

## Origin of the Tarot

The tarot system originated on Venus during Ra's third-density experience:

> "The tarot was devised by the third-density population of Venus a great measure of your space/time in your past... The product of many, many generations of work upon what we conceived to be the archetypical mind produced the tarot which was used by our peoples as a training aid in developing the magical personality." (88.14)

When Ra taught in Egypt, priests created visual representations. These images were later influenced by Sumerian and Chaldean astrology, resulting in the tarot we know today. Ra considers the Egyptian tarot "the most undistorted version" of their original teaching.

**Important**: The Minor Arcana and Court cards are NOT part of Ra's teaching - they "were the product of the influence of those of Chaldea and Sumer" (88.22). Only the 22 Major Arcana represent Ra's archetypical system.

## Structure: Three Cycles + The Choice

The 22 archetypes are organized as:

```

> "The philosophy was to create a foundation, first of mind, then of body, and then of spiritual complex. Those concept complexes you call the tarot lie then in three groups of seven: the mind cycle, one through seven; the physical complex cycle, eight through fourteen; the spiritual complex cycle, fifteen through twenty-one. The last concept complex may best be termed The Choice." (77.12)

## The Seven Stages

Each cycle contains the same seven stages, applied to its respective complex:

| Stage | Function | Pre-Veil? |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Matrix** | The foundation, conscious starting point | Yes |
| **Potentiator** | The unconscious resource, hidden depths | Yes |
| **Catalyst** | That which triggers change | No* |
| **Experience** | The result of processed catalyst | No* |
| **Significator** | The actor and that which is acted upon | Yes |
| **Transformation** | The crucial change point | No* |
| **Great Way** | The environment and culmination | No* |

*These four archetypes evolved after the Logos introduced the veil (79.20)

## Ra's Recommended Study Method

Ra taught the archetypes in three progressive stages (88.24-88.25):

### Stage 1: Study in Triads (Vertical Relationships)

View archetypes across cycles to understand how the same function operates in mind, body, and spirit:

> "Our first stage was the presentation of the images, one after the other, in the following order: one, eight, fifteen; two, nine, sixteen; three, ten, seventeen; four, eleven, eighteen; five, twelve, nineteen; six, thirteen, twenty; seven, fourteen, twenty-one; twenty-two. In this way the fundamental relationships between mind, body, and spirit could begin to be discovered." (88.24)

**Study Order:**
1. All Matrices: 1, 8, 15
2. All Potentiators: 2, 9, 16
3. All Catalysts: 3, 10, 17
4. All Experiences: 4, 11, 18
5. All Significators: 5, 12, 19
6. All Transformations: 6, 13, 20
7. All Great Ways: 7, 14, 21
8. The Choice: 22

### Stage 2: Study in Pairs (Horizontal Relationships)

Examine archetypes in functional pairs within each cycle:

> "The second stage of Ra's teaching was that of considering archetypes in pairs. The consideration of the pairings is that of polarity." (88.25)

**Pairing Structure:**
- **1 & 2** (Matrix & Potentiator): Conscious & Unconscious
- **3 & 4** (Catalyst & Experience): Input & Output
- **5** (Significator): Stands alone initially
- **6 & 7** (Transformation & Great Way): Change & Environment
- **5 & 22** (Significator & Choice): The self and its fundamental decision

This pairing applies to all three cycles (Mind, Body, Spirit).

### Stage 3: Embodiment

The final stage is learning to "become" each archetype:

> "The third stage was the suggestion of archetypes being studied by the student on its own so that each archetype might then be further examined as to its particular qualities in a more conscious way... The final step... was the proper use of the archetypical mind. The student may see each archetype as a complex, as it is, but each archetype can be used in a single fashion. In this use, these archetypes become quite eloquent... the student, being now aware of all the complexities of the archetypical mind, is empowered to eventually become the archetype at will." (88.26)

Ra explains the practical application:

> "We shall offer an example based upon this first explored archetype... The conscious mind of the adept may be full to bursting of the most abstruse and unmanageable of ideas, so that further ideation becomes impossible and work in blue ray or indigo is blocked through over-activation. It is then that the adept would call upon the new mind, untouched and virgin, and dwell within the archetype of the new and unblemished mind without bias, without polarity, full of the magic of the Logos." (91.35)

## Important Cautions from Ra

### Not Divination
> "The Major Arcana have no rightful place in divination but, rather, are tools for the further knowledge of the self by the self for the purpose of entering a more profoundly, acutely realized present moment." (88.23)

### Not a Complete System
> "The archetypical mind does not resolve any paradox or bring all into unity. This is not the property of any resource which is of the third density. Therefore, may we ask the student to look up from inward working and behold the glory, the might, the majesty, the mystery, and the peace of oneness." (97.9)

### Personal Interpretation Expected
> "Each archetype is a significant ding an sich, or thing in itself... Each student may see some other nuance." (91.34)

### Move Beyond the Written
> "After a period of study, the discipline mastered sufficiently, the seeker may then complete the more important step: that is, the moving beyond the written in order to express in an unique fashion its understanding... of the archetypical mind." (76.9)
