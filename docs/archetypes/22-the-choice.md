## Ra's Core Description

The Choice is unique among the archetypes - it stands apart from the three cycles and is described as **"relatively fixed and single"**:

> "The Logos under which these foundations stand is one of free will. Thusly the foundations may be seen to have unique facets and relationships for each mind/body/spirit complex. Only twenty-two, The Choice, is relatively fixed and single." (77.13)

Ra calls it **"the axis upon which the creation turns"**:

> "The choice is, as you put it, the work of a moment but is the axis upon which the creation turns." (76.16)

## Function in the Archetypical System

The Choice is:
- **The fundamental polarity decision**: Service to Others or Service to Self
- **The axis of creation**: Everything turns on this choice
- **Fixed and single**: Unlike other archetypes, it is the same for all entities
- **Paired with all Significators**: The self that makes the Choice

### The Great Breakthrough

Ra reveals that understanding The Choice was their own great breakthrough after third density:

> "The one great breakthrough which was made after our work in third density was done was the proper emphasis given to the Arcanum Number Twenty-Two which we have called The Choice. In our own experience we were aware that such an unifying archetype existed but did not give that archetype the proper complex of concepts in order to most efficaciously use that archetype in order to promote our evolution." (88.16)

## Key Quotes from Ra

### On the Purpose of Third Density
> "The polarization or choosing of each mind/body/spirit is necessary for harvestability from third density. The higher densities do their work due to the polarity gained in this choice." (77.16)

### On The Choice's Uniqueness
> "Only twenty-two, The Choice, is relatively fixed and single." (77.13)

### On The Axis of Creation
> "The choice is, as you put it, the work of a moment but is the axis upon which the creation turns." (76.16)

### On Third Density's Purpose
> "Third density is a choice." (76.15)

### On Ra's Own Learning
> "In our own experience we were aware that such an unifying archetype existed but did not give that archetype the proper complex of concepts in order to most efficaciously use that archetype in order to promote our evolution." (88.16)

## Visual Symbolism Analysis

The traditional tarot image (The Fool) shows themes of beginning and choice:

| Symbol | Possible Meaning |
|--------|------------------|
| **Figure at cliff edge** | The moment of choice, stepping into unknown |
| **Bundle/bag** | What is carried into the new journey |
| **Dog** | Instinct, warning, or encouragement |
| **White rose** | Purity of intention |
| **Sun** | Illumination of the choice |
| **Cliff/precipice** | The leap of faith required |
| **Number 0/22** | Beginning and completion, outside the sequence |

### The Fool's Position

The Fool is typically numbered 0 and can be placed at the beginning or end of the Major Arcana - or outside the sequence entirely. This reflects The Choice's unique nature:
- It is the beginning of the journey (choosing a path)
- It is the culmination (the purpose of all archetype work)
- It stands outside the three cycles

## Relationships

### Paired with the Significators
Ra specifically pairs The Choice with the three Significators (5, 12, 19):

> "The Significator was left unpaired, as it shall be paired with Archetype Twenty-Two." (88.25 paraphrased)

This pairing recognizes that:
- The Significator is the self (mind, body, spirit)
- The Choice is what the self must make
- The Significators exist precisely to make this Choice

### Relationship to All Archetypes

The 21 archetypes of the three cycles all serve to bring the entity to The Choice:
- They provide the environment (Great Ways)
- They offer the catalyst
- They record the experience
- They enable transformation
- All pointing toward the fundamental decision of polarity

## Contemplation Prompts

1. **Your Fundamental Choice**: What is your fundamental orientation - service to others or service to self? How does this manifest in daily life?

2. **The Axis of Your Creation**: If The Choice is the axis upon which creation turns, what is the axis of your personal creation?

3. **The Work of a Moment**: Ra says The Choice is "the work of a moment." Yet it is also continuous. How do you hold both truths?

4. **The Fool's Leap**: The Fool steps off a cliff. What leap of faith does your Choice require?

5. **What Ra Learned**: Ra admits they didn't properly emphasize The Choice in their own third density. What does this teach about the importance of this archetype?

## The Two Paths

### Service to Others (Positive Path)
- Orientation toward serving other-selves
- Requires 51%+ service-to-others orientation for harvest
- Leads through fourth and fifth density positive
- Emphasis on love, compassion, and unity

### Service to Self (Negative Path)
- Orientation toward serving the self
- Requires 95%+ service-to-self orientation for harvest
- Leads through fourth and fifth density negative
- Emphasis on control, power, and separation

Both paths are valid choices for the Creator to know Itself. The Choice is not about "good" versus "evil" but about which path the entity will take in its return to the One.
