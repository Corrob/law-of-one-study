# Stage 3: Embodiment (Becoming the Archetypes)

## Ra's Teaching

Ra's third and final stage of archetype study involves learning to **become** each archetype:

> "The third stage was the suggestion of archetypes being studied by the student on its own so that each archetype might then be further examined as to its particular qualities in a more conscious way." (88.26)

The goal is practical application:

> "The final step... was the proper use of the archetypical mind. The student may see each archetype as a complex, as it is, but each archetype can be used in a single fashion. In this use, these archetypes become quite eloquent... the student, being now aware of all the complexities of the archetypical mind, is empowered to eventually become the archetype at will." (88.26)

## Purpose

The ultimate purpose of archetype study is not intellectual understanding but **practical use**:

- To consciously adopt an archetype's perspective when helpful
- To call upon archetypal resources in specific situations
- To "dwell within" an archetype to access its unique gifts
- To accelerate spiritual evolution through conscious use

## Ra's Practical Example

Ra offers a concrete example of embodiment using the Matrix of Mind:

> "We shall offer an example based upon this first explored archetype or concept complex. The conscious mind of the adept may be full to bursting of the most abstruse and unmanageable of ideas, so that further ideation becomes impossible and work in blue ray or indigo is blocked through over-activation. It is then that the adept would call upon the new mind, untouched and virgin, and dwell within the archetype of the new and unblemished mind without bias, without polarity, full of the magic of the Logos." (91.35)

**The Practice**:
- **Situation**: Mind is overwhelmed, blocked by too many complex ideas
- **Archetype Called**: Matrix of Mind (the unfed, unblemished conscious mind)
- **Method**: "Dwell within" the archetype
- **Result**: Access to the pure, unbiased, magical mind-state

## Framework for Embodiment

## Practice Methods

### Basic Embodiment Meditation

1. **Prepare**: Sit quietly, breathe deeply, center yourself
2. **Select**: Choose an archetype appropriate to your current need
3. **Visualize**: Call the image to mind; see it clearly
4. **Remember**: Recall Ra's descriptions and the archetype's essence
5. **Become**: Allow yourself to "dwell within" the archetype
6. **Experience**: Notice what shifts in your awareness, feeling, or perspective
7. **Return**: Gently return to normal consciousness, carrying the insight
8. **Apply**: Use what you accessed in your situation

### Extended Contemplation

For deeper work with a single archetype:

1. **Study**: Read the archetype document thoroughly
2. **Gaze**: Spend time with the tarot image
3. **Contemplate**: Work with the reflection prompts
4. **Meditate**: Practice the basic embodiment meditation daily
5. **Journal**: Record experiences and insights
6. **Apply**: Consciously use the archetype in daily life
7. **Review**: After a period (week or more), assess what you learned

### Progressive Embodiment Practice

Work through all 22 archetypes over time:

**Option A: Sequential** (22 weeks)
- One archetype per week
- Follow the numerical order (1-22)
- End with The Choice as culmination

**Option B: By Triads** (8 weeks)
- One triad per week
- Embody all three related archetypes together
- Compare and contrast the experiences

**Option C: By Pairs** (11 weeks)
- One pair per week
- Embody both archetypes, then their dynamic together
- End with Significator/Choice pairing

## Cautions from Ra

### Not a Complete System

> "The archetypical mind does not resolve any paradox or bring all into unity. This is not the property of any resource which is of the third density. Therefore, may we ask the student to look up from inward working and behold the glory, the might, the majesty, the mystery, and the peace of oneness." (97.9)

The archetypes are tools, not the destination. Always return to contemplation of the One Infinite Creator.

### Personal Interpretation Required

> "Each archetype is a significant ding an sich, or thing in itself... Each student may see some other nuance." (91.34)

Your experience of embodiment will be unique. Trust your own insights while remaining grounded in Ra's teaching.

### Move Beyond the Written

> "After a period of study, the discipline mastered sufficiently, the seeker may then complete the more important step: that is, the moving beyond the written in order to express in an unique fashion its understanding... of the archetypical mind." (76.9)

The ultimate goal is not to repeat Ra's descriptions but to develop your own living relationship with the archetypes.

## Signs of Progress

As you develop embodiment capacity, you may notice:

1. **Spontaneous Recognition**: Seeing archetypal patterns in daily life
2. **Intuitive Selection**: Knowing which archetype to call without deliberation
3. **Rapid Access**: Quickly entering an archetypal state when needed
4. **Integration**: The archetypes becoming part of your natural awareness
5. **Creativity**: Expressing your understanding in unique ways
6. **Service**: Using archetypal awareness to serve others
7. **Unity**: Seeing through the archetypes to the One behind all forms

## The Magical Personality

Ra mentions that the tarot was originally "a training aid in developing the magical personality" (88.14). The magical personality is:

> "That which is capable of manipulating the forces of creation in order to create the atmosphere of which we have spoken, the higher density atmosphere." (75.32)

Through embodiment practice, the student develops:
- Conscious access to deep mind resources
- Capacity to shift perspective at will
- Ability to work with archetypal energies
- The magical personality that serves polarized purpose

---

## Integration with The Choice

All embodiment practice ultimately serves The Choice - the fundamental decision of polarity:

- **Service to Others**: Embodying archetypes to serve others and the One
- **Service to Self**: Embodying archetypes to serve the self and gain power

The archetypes themselves are neutral. How you use them - and why - determines your polarity.

> "The choice is, as you put it, the work of a moment but is the axis upon which the creation turns." (76.16)

## Summary: The Three Stages

| Stage | Focus | Practice |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **1. Triads** | Vertical relationships | Compare same function across mind, body, spirit |
| **2. Pairs** | Horizontal relationships | Study complementary archetypes together |
| **3. Embodiment** | Practical application | Become the archetype at will |

Each stage builds on the previous. Triads teach you the system's structure. Pairs teach you the dynamics. Embodiment teaches you to use what you've learned.

The goal is not to master a system but to accelerate your evolution through conscious use of the resources the Logos has designed for your journey.

## Final Contemplation

> "May we ask the student to look up from inward working and behold the glory, the might, the majesty, the mystery, and the peace of oneness." (97.9)

The archetypes are a map, not the territory. Use them wisely, then look up - to the One Infinite Creator who designed them for your journey home.
