# Stage 1: Study in Triads (Vertical Relationships)

## Ra's Teaching

Ra's first stage of archetype study involves viewing archetypes **across cycles** to discover the relationships between mind, body, and spirit:

> "Our first stage was the presentation of the images, one after the other, in the following order: one, eight, fifteen; two, nine, sixteen; three, ten, seventeen; four, eleven, eighteen; five, twelve, nineteen; six, thirteen, twenty; seven, fourteen, twenty-one; twenty-two. In this way the fundamental relationships between mind, body, and spirit could begin to be discovered." (88.24)

## Purpose

By studying the same archetypal function (e.g., Matrix) across all three cycles, you discover:

- How the same principle manifests differently in mind, body, and spirit
- The unique character of each cycle
- The underlying unity beneath the differences
- How mind, body, and spirit work together as aspects of one being

## The Seven Triads

### Triad 1: The Matrices (1, 8, 15)
*The foundations of each cycle*

| Archetype | Ra's Description | Image |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| [1 - Matrix of Mind](../mind-cycle/01-matrix-of-mind.md) | "That from which all comes... the activator in potentiation" | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot01.jpg) |
| [8 - Matrix of Body](../body-cycle/08-matrix-of-body.md) | "Unrestricted motion" | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot08.jpg) |
| [15 - Matrix of Spirit](../spirit-cycle/15-matrix-of-spirit.md) | "The deepest darkness" | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot15.jpg) |

**Contemplation**: The Matrix of Mind reaches but is unmoving. The Matrix of Body moves freely. The Matrix of Spirit rests in darkness. What does this teach about the fundamental nature of mind, body, and spirit?

### Triad 2: The Potentiators (2, 9, 16)
*The hidden resources of each cycle*

| Archetype | Ra's Description | Image |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| [2 - Potentiator of Mind](../mind-cycle/02-potentiator-of-mind.md) | "The great sea into which consciousness dips" | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot02.jpg) |
| [9 - Potentiator of Body](../body-cycle/09-potentiator-of-body.md) | "That which, being informed, regulates activity" | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot09.jpg) |
| [16 - Potentiator of Spirit](../spirit-cycle/16-potentiator-of-spirit.md) | "The most sudden awakening, illuminating, and generative influence" | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot16.jpg) |

**Contemplation**: Mind's Potentiator awaits patiently (High Priestess). Body's Potentiator regulates steadily (Hermit). Spirit's Potentiator illuminates suddenly (Tower). Why these different modes?

---

### Triad 3: The Catalysts (3, 10, 17)
*The triggers for change in each cycle*

| Archetype | Ra's Description | Image |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| [3 - Catalyst of Mind](../mind-cycle/03-catalyst-of-mind.md) | "All that assaults your senses... all that is unprocessed" | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot03.jpg) |
| [10 - Catalyst of Body](../body-cycle/10-catalyst-of-body.md) | Physical triggers, fortune's wheel | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot10.jpg) |
| [17 - Catalyst of Spirit](../spirit-cycle/17-catalyst-of-spirit.md) | Spiritual triggers, hope and despair | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot17.jpg) |

**Contemplation**: Mental catalyst often suggests the negative path (Empress glancing left). Physical catalyst appears random (Wheel). Spiritual catalyst brings hope after crisis (Star after Tower). What patterns do you see?

---

### Triad 4: The Experiences (4, 11, 18)
*The results of processed catalyst*

| Archetype | Ra's Description | Image |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| [4 - Experience of Mind](../mind-cycle/04-experience-of-mind.md) | Processed catalyst, accumulated bias | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot04.jpg) |
| [11 - Experience of Body](../body-cycle/11-experience-of-body.md) | Embodied wisdom, physical mastery | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot11.jpg) |
| [18 - Experience of Spirit](../spirit-cycle/18-experience-of-spirit.md) | The dark night, indirect knowing | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot18.jpg) |

**Contemplation**: Mental experience brings stability (Emperor). Physical experience brings mastery (Enchantress). Spiritual experience brings the dark night (Moon). Why is spiritual experience the most challenging?

### Triad 5: The Significators (5, 12, 19)
*The self as actor in each cycle*

| Archetype | Ra's Description | Image |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| [5 - Significator of Mind](../mind-cycle/05-significator-of-mind.md) | "Actor possessed of free will... has the will to know" | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot05.jpg) |
| [12 - Significator of Body](../body-cycle/12-significator-of-body.md) | The suspended self, patient waiting | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot12.jpg) |
| [19 - Significator of Spirit](../spirit-cycle/19-significator-of-spirit.md) | The radiant self, full illumination | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot19.jpg) |

**Contemplation**: Mind's Significator is bounded (Hierophant in rectangle). Body's is suspended (Hanged Man). Spirit's is radiant (Sun). How does the self manifest differently in each realm?

*Note: All three Significators are paired with The Choice (22).*

### Triad 6: The Transformations (6, 13, 20)
*The crucial change points*

| Archetype | Ra's Description | Image |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| [6 - Transformation of Mind](../mind-cycle/06-transformation-of-mind.md) | "One principle governing deep mind must be abandoned" | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot06.jpg) |
| [13 - Transformation of Body](../body-cycle/13-transformation-of-body.md) | Death of old form, physical rebirth | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot13.jpg) |
| [20 - Transformation of Spirit](../spirit-cycle/20-transformation-of-spirit.md) | The call to new being, resurrection | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot20.jpg) |

**Contemplation**: Mental transformation requires choice between approaches (Lovers/Two Paths). Physical transformation requires death of the old (Death). Spiritual transformation requires answering a call (Judgement). What must be abandoned in each realm?

---

### Triad 7: The Great Ways (7, 14, 21)
*The environments for evolution*

| Archetype | Ra's Description | Image |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| [7 - Great Way of Mind](../mind-cycle/07-great-way-of-mind.md) | "The milieu within which the work of mind shall be placed" | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot07.jpg) |
| [14 - Great Way of Body](../body-cycle/14-great-way-of-body.md) | Alchemical blending, temperance | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot14.jpg) |
| [21 - Great Way of Spirit](../spirit-cycle/21-great-way-of-spirit.md) | Cosmic dance, integration, the Adept | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot21.jpg) |

**Contemplation**: Mind's Great Way is majestic movement (Chariot). Body's is patient alchemy (Temperance). Spirit's is cosmic completion (World). What is the environment for your work in each realm?

---

### The Choice (22)
*The unifying archetype*

After studying all seven triads, contemplate [The Choice](../22-the-choice.md) - the 22nd archetype that stands alone:

| Archetype | Ra's Description | Image |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| [22 - The Choice](../22-the-choice.md) | "The axis upon which the creation turns" | [View](https://www.lawofone.info/images/tarot22.jpg) |

**Contemplation**: All 21 archetypes serve The Choice. How does understanding the triads illuminate the nature of your fundamental polarity decision?

## Practice Suggestions

### Basic Triad Meditation
1. Choose one triad (e.g., the Matrices: 1, 8, 15)
2. View all three images together
3. Read Ra's descriptions for each
4. Contemplate: What is the same? What is different? Why?
5. Journal your insights

### Progressive Study
Work through all seven triads in order:
1. Week 1: Matrices (1, 8, 15)
2. Week 2: Potentiators (2, 9, 16)
3. Week 3: Catalysts (3, 10, 17)
4. Week 4: Experiences (4, 11, 18)
5. Week 5: Significators (5, 12, 19)
6. Week 6: Transformations (6, 13, 20)
7. Week 7: Great Ways (7, 14, 21)
8. Week 8: The Choice (22) and integration

### Questions for Each Triad
- How does this function manifest in my mental life?
- How does it manifest in my physical life?
- How does it manifest in my spiritual life?
- What is the relationship between these three manifestations?
- How do mind, body, and spirit work together through this function?

---

## Key Insight

The triads reveal that mind, body, and spirit are not separate but three aspects of one unified being. The same archetypal functions operate in all three, but manifest according to the nature of each realm:

- **Mind**: Reaches, thinks, conceives
- **Body**: Moves, acts, manifests
- **Spirit**: Rests in depth, then suddenly illuminates

Understanding these relationships is the foundation for the more advanced work of pairs and embodiment.
