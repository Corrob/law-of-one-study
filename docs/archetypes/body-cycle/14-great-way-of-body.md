## Ra's Core Description

The Great Way represents the **environment** within which the entire cycle operates. For the body, this is the framework for physical evolution - the milieu in which the work of body takes place.

> "The Great Way of Mind, Body, or Spirit is intended to limn the milieu within which the work of mind, body, or spirit shall be placed." (100.7)

The traditional Temperance/Alchemist card shows the blending and transformation of physical elements - suggesting that the Great Way of Body involves the ongoing alchemical work of physical existence.

## Function in the Archetypical System

The Great Way of Body is:
- **The environment**: The framework for physical evolution
- **A summary**: Reflects and summarizes Archetypes 8-13
- **The pathway**: The ongoing journey of body
- **Alchemical work**: The mixing and transformation of physical elements

### The Alchemist's Work

The Temperance card traditionally shows:
- An angel mixing substances between cups
- The blending of opposites into a new unity
- Patient, ongoing work with physical matter
- The transmutation of base elements into gold (spiritual evolution through matter)

## Visual Symbolism Analysis

| **Angel/figure** | The higher self guiding physical work |
| **Two cups** | Opposites, polarities to be balanced |
| **Flowing water** | The continuous movement between states |
| **One foot on land, one in water** | Bridge between material and emotional/spiritual |
| **Path to mountains** | The long journey of physical evolution |
| **Sun/crown** | Illumination as the goal of the work |

*Note: Ra did not specifically analyze this image as was done for the Mind cycle cards.*

## Relationships

### Triad Relationship (Great Ways)
The Great Way of Body relates to:
- **Great Way of Mind (7)**: The Chariot - the mental environment and journey
- **Great Way of Spirit (21)**: The World/Adept - the spiritual environment and completion

Mind's Great Way shows majestic movement; Body's Great Way shows alchemical blending; Spirit's Great Way shows cosmic completion.
