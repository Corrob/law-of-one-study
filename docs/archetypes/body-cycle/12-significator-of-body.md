## Ra's Core Description

The Significator represents the **complex itself** - in this case, the physical vehicle as both actor and acted upon. Before the veil, it was simple and unified; after, it became complex.

> "The Significator of each mind, body, and spirit may be seen as a simple and unified concept." (79.20)

The Hanged Man traditionally shows a figure suspended upside-down - suggesting that the body's significance may require a reversal of perspective.

## Function in the Archetypical System

The Significator of Body is:
- **The physical self**: The body as the entity that acts and is acted upon
- **Made complex by the veil**: Gained layers of meaning after veiling
- **The instrument**: Through which mind and spirit manifest
- **Suspended between worlds**: The Hanged Man suggests liminality

### The Suspension Symbolism

The Hanged Man's upside-down position suggests:
- Seeing physical existence from a new perspective
- Sacrifice or surrender of the body's usual orientation
- The body as suspended between matter and spirit
- Patience and waiting in physical form

## Key Quotes from Ra

### On the Pre-Veil Significator
> "The Significator of each mind, body, and spirit may be seen as a simple and unified concept." (79.20)

### On the Body as Instrument
> "The body is the creature of the mind and is the instrument of manifestation for the fruits of mind and spirit." (81.13)

### On Significator Generally
> "The Significator could no longer be seen as simply the self, but rather as that self modified by the interrelationship of the conscious with the unconscious." (79.36)

**Note**: Ra did not provide detailed analysis of this specific archetype comparable to the Significator of Mind (Archetype 5).

## Visual Symbolism Analysis

The traditional tarot image (The Hanged Man) shows profound themes:

| Symbol | Possible Meaning |
|--------|------------------|
| **Upside-down figure** | Reversal of perspective on physical existence |
| **Suspension** | Between worlds, patient waiting |
| **Calm expression** | Peace in suspension, acceptance |
| **One leg crossed** | Choice, the shape of number 4 (stability) |
| **Hands behind back** | Surrender of physical agency |
| **Halo/light** | Illumination through suspension |

*Note: Ra did not specifically analyze this image as was done for the Mind cycle cards.*

## Relationships

### Triad Relationship (Significators)
The Significator of Body relates to:
- **Significator of Mind (5)**: The Hierophant - the complex mental self
- **Significator of Spirit (19)**: The Sun - the illuminated spiritual self

Mind's Significator wills and knows; Body's Significator suspends and waits; Spirit's Significator radiates and connects.

### Pair Relationship (Significator & Choice)
All three Significators (5, 12, 19) are eventually paired with The Choice (22):
- The Significator is the self that makes the Choice
- The body is the vehicle through which the Choice is manifested
- Physical existence is the arena for the polarity decision

## Contemplation Prompts

1. **The Hanged Man**: What might it mean to see your physical existence upside-down? What new perspective might this offer?

2. **Suspension Between Worlds**: The body exists between the spiritual and the material. How do you experience this in-between state?

3. **Patient Waiting**: The Hanged Man waits peacefully. What is your body waiting for? What patience does physical existence require?

4. **Sacrifice and Surrender**: What physical attachments or orientations might need to be surrendered for transformation?

5. **The Body as Actor**: How is your body both actor (doing) and acted upon (receiving)? Where do you experience this most clearly?
