## Ra's Core Description

The Potentiator of Body is that which **regulates** the body's unrestricted motion:

> "The Matrix of the Body may be seen to be a reflection in opposites of the mind; that is, unrestricted motion. The Potentiator of the Body then is that which, being informed, regulates activity." (79.20)

Where the Potentiator of Mind is the vast unconscious sea awaiting the reaching of consciousness, the Potentiator of Body is the **informed regulator** of physical activity.

## Function in the Archetypical System

The Potentiator of Body is:
- **The regulator**: Governs and shapes bodily activity
- **Informed**: Has knowledge or programming that guides regulation
- **Counterpart to unrestricted motion**: Provides structure to the body's freedom
- **The body's hidden resource**: Like mind's Potentiator, but manifesting as regulation rather than depth

### The Regulation Dynamic

The Matrix-Potentiator relationship in the Body cycle:
- Matrix of Body = Unrestricted motion (pure capacity to move)
- Potentiator of Body = Informed regulation (wisdom that shapes action)

This suggests that the body's "unconscious" is not a sea of resources to be courted, but a regulatory intelligence that shapes how motion manifests.

## Key Quotes from Ra

### On Regulation
> "The Potentiator of the Body then is that which, being informed, regulates activity." (79.20)

### On the Body Generally
> "The body complex is truly a creation of the mind complex." (61.7)

**Note**: Ra did not provide detailed analysis of this archetype comparable to the Mind cycle. The Hermit/Sage imagery suggests wisdom guiding physical existence.

## Visual Symbolism Analysis

The traditional tarot image (The Hermit) shows themes of guidance and wisdom:

| Symbol | Possible Meaning |
|--------|------------------|
| **Robed figure** | Wisdom, withdrawal, inner guidance |
| **Lantern/light** | Illuminating the path, informed guidance |
| **Staff** | Support for the journey, regulation of movement |
| **Solitary stance** | Inner wisdom, self-regulation |

*Note: Ra did not specifically analyze this image as was done for the Mind cycle cards.*

## Relationships

### Triad Relationship (Potentiators)
The Potentiator of Body relates to:
- **Potentiator of Mind (2)**: The unconscious sea awaiting the reaching
- **Potentiator of Spirit (16)**: "The most sudden awakening, illuminating, and generative influence" (79.20)

Mind's Potentiator awaits; Body's Potentiator regulates; Spirit's Potentiator illuminates suddenly.

### Pair Relationship (Matrix & Potentiator)
The Matrix of Body (8) and Potentiator of Body (9) form a pair:
- Matrix provides the capacity for unrestricted motion
- Potentiator provides informed regulation of that motion
- Together they describe physical existence as freedom shaped by wisdom
