## Ra's Core Description

The Significator represents the **mind/body/spirit complex itself** - the self that acts and is acted upon. Before the veil, it was simple and unified. After the veil, it became complex:

> "The Hierophant is the original archetype of mind which has been made complex through the subtile movements of the conscious and unconscious. The complexities of mind were evolved rather than the simple melding of experience from Potentiator to Matrix. The mind itself became an actor possessed of free will and, more especially, will. As the Significator of the mind, the Hierophant has the will to know, but what shall it do with its knowledge, and for what reasons does it seek?" (79.42)

## Function in the Archetypical System

The Significator of Mind is:
- **Both actor and acted upon**: The self in its totality
- **The complex self**: Made complex by the veil
- **Possessed of will**: Has the desire and capacity to seek
- **The one who chooses**: Paired with The Choice (Archetype 22)

### Bounded by the Physical

Ra emphasizes that thoughts cannot act without the body:

> "O student, you have grasped the barest essence of the nature of the Significator's complete envelopment within the rectangle. Consider for the self, O student, whether your thoughts can walk. The abilities of the most finely honed mentality shall not be known without the use of the physical vehicle which you call the body. Through the mouth the mind may speak. Through the limbs the mind may effect action." (97.10)

## Key Quotes from Ra

### On the Pre-Veil Significator
> "The Significator of each mind, body, and spirit may be seen as a simple and unified concept." (79.20)

### On Post-Veil Complexity
> "The Significator became a complex. The Significator could no longer be seen as simply the self, but rather as that self modified by the interrelationship of the conscious with the unconscious." (79.36)

### On the Two Figures at Base
> "The indications of polarity are as presumed by the questioner. The symbolism of old for the left-hand path was the russet coloration." (97.13)

### On the Paradox of Polarity
> "The nature of polarity is interesting in that those experiences offered to the Significator as positive frequently become recorded as productive of biases which may be seen to be negative, whereas the fruit of those experiences apparently negative is frequently found to be helpful in the development of the service-to-others bias." (97.16)

### On the Wings
> "The Significator owns a covenant with the spirit which it shall in some cases manifest through the thought and action of the adept. If there is protection in a promise, then you have chosen the correct sound vibration, for the outstretched wings of spirit, high above manifestation, yet draw the caged mind onward." (99.7)

## Visual Symbolism Analysis

Based on Ra's discussion of the tarot image (sessions 97, 99):

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Male figure** | The conscious, acting self |
| **Rectangular enclosure** | Bounded by the physical, unable to act without body |
| **Two figures below** | Polarity available - originally russet (left path) and white (right path) |
| **Seated/immobile** | Thoughts cannot walk without the body |
| **Hand gestures** | "Right hand gestures in service to others... left hand attempts to absorb the power of the spirit" (97.16) |
| **Eight cartouches** | Octaves of being, energy centers (97.17) |
| **Wings above** | Spirit's protection and promise, drawing the caged mind onward |

Ra's clarifications:
- The "black" figure was originally red/russet (97.12)
- The cartouches contain "letters and words" meaning roughly "And you shall be born again to eternal life" (97.18)

## Relationships

### Triad Relationship (Significators)
The Significator of Mind relates to:
- **Significator of Body (12)**: The physical self, The Hanged Man - sacrifice and new perspective
- **Significator of Spirit (19)**: The spiritual self, The Sun - the fully illuminated self

The Mind Significator thinks and wills; the Body Significator acts and experiences; the Spirit Significator connects and transcends.

### Pair Relationship (Significator & Choice)
The Significator (5, 12, 19) stands alone among the pairs, to be paired with The Choice (22):

> "The Significator was left unpaired, as it shall be paired with Archetype Twenty-Two." (88.25 paraphrased)

This pairing recognizes that the Significator is the self that makes the fundamental Choice of polarity.

## Contemplation Prompts

1. **The Caged Mind**: Consider that "your thoughts cannot walk." How dependent is your mental life on your physical vehicle?

2. **Will to Know**: Ra asks, "The Hierophant has the will to know, but what shall it do with its knowledge, and for what reasons does it seek?" Answer this for yourself.

3. **Two Paths Within**: The two figures at the base represent both polarities available to you. Can you sense both potentials within yourself?

4. **Acted and Acting**: You are "both actor and acted upon." Where in your life do you act? Where are you acted upon? Can you see both as aspects of the same self?

5. **The Wings Above**: What is your "covenant with spirit"? How does spirit draw your caged mind onward?
