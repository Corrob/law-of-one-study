## Ra's Core Description

> "The Matrix of Mind is that from which all comes. It is unmoving yet is the activator in potentiation of all mind activity." (79.20)

The Matrix of Mind represents the **conscious mind** in its pure, unfed state - consciousness before it has drawn upon the resources of the unconscious (Potentiator). Ra emphasizes this is not the complex, experienced mind we normally identify with:

> "We ask the student to consider the concept of the unfed conscious mind, the mind without any resource but consciousness. Do not confuse the unfed conscious mind with that mass of complexities which you as students experience, as you have so many, many times dipped already into the processes of potentiation, catalyst, experience, and transformation." (91.33)

## Function in the Archetypical System

The Matrix of Mind is:
- **The reaching principle**: It actively seeks experience and resources
- **The male principle**: "That which reaches may be seen as a male principle" (92.20)
- **Pure potential**: Unfed, unbiased, without polarity
- **The activator**: While unmoving itself, it activates all mind activity

### Relationship to Potentiator (Archetype 2)

The Matrix reaches toward the Potentiator, which awaits that reaching:

> "The Matrix of the Mind is that which reaches. The Potentiator of the Mind is that great resource which may be seen as the sea into which the consciousness dips ever deeper and more thoroughly in order to create, ideate, and become more self-conscious." (79.20)

This is the fundamental conscious/unconscious dynamic that underlies all mental activity.

## Key Quotes from Ra

### On the Nature of the Matrix
> "The Matrix of Mind is the conscious mind and is further enspirited by the Potentiator of the Mind." (78.11)

### On Its Pre-Veil State
> "The Matrix of the Mind is that which reaches. One way of considering this concept is that it represents the conscious mind in its unfed state—that is, conscious but without resource." (91.14)

### On Visual Symbolism
> "The Matrix of the Mind is depicted as a male... We may note that the Matrix of the Mind is described as the Magician by your peoples. That the material of the Matrix is of the spirit is quite evident." (91.19)

### Practical Application
> "The conscious mind of the adept may be full to bursting of the most abstruse and unmanageable of ideas, so that further ideation becomes impossible and work in blue ray or indigo is blocked through over-activation. It is then that the adept would call upon the new mind, untouched and virgin, and dwell within the archetype of the new and unblemished mind without bias, without polarity, full of the magic of the Logos." (91.35)

## Visual Symbolism Analysis

Based on Ra's discussion of the tarot image (sessions 91, 96):

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Male figure** | The reaching, active principle |
| **Sphere in hand** | "The sphere of spiritual power" (91.22) |
| **Bird** | "The flight of the Matrix" reaching toward spirit |
| **Reaching posture** | Active seeking of experience/resources |
| **Stars (removed)** | Ra suggested removing astrological additions |
| **Wand (removed)** | Ra suggested removing; sphere is the key symbol |

Ra's corrections to the image (96.15):
- Remove stars
- Remove wand
- Keep sphere, held "by the thumb and index and second finger"

## Relationships

### Triad Relationship (Matrices)
The Matrix of Mind relates to:
- **Matrix of Body (8)**: "A reflection in opposites of the mind; that is, unrestricted motion" (79.20)
- **Matrix of Spirit (15)**: "The deepest darkness" (79.20)

While Matrix of Mind reaches, Matrix of Body moves, and Matrix of Spirit rests in darkness awaiting illumination.

### Pair Relationship (Matrix & Potentiator)
The Matrix (1) and Potentiator (2) form the fundamental conscious/unconscious pair:
- Matrix reaches; Potentiator awaits
- Matrix is male principle; Potentiator is female principle
- Matrix is conscious; Potentiator is unconscious

## Contemplation Prompts

1. **Pure Consciousness**: Can you imagine your mind without any accumulated experience, bias, or polarity? What would pure, unfed consciousness feel like?

2. **The Reaching**: In what ways does your conscious mind "reach" toward the unconscious? What practices help you access deeper resources?

3. **Return to Simplicity**: When your mind is overwhelmed with complexity, how might you "call upon the new mind, untouched and virgin"?

4. **The Magician's Power**: The Magician holds spiritual power (the sphere). What does it mean that consciousness itself contains the seed of spiritual power?
