## Ra's Core Description

The Great Way represents the **environment** within which the entire cycle operates, as well as its culmination. It is not a final achievement but rather the framework for ongoing work:

> "As one observes the veil of the image of the Great Way of Mind it may be helpful to ideate using the framework of environment. The Great Way of Mind, Body, or Spirit is intended to limn the milieu within which the work of mind, body, or spirit shall be placed." (100.7)

Ra also describes it as a summary and pathway:

> "The Archetype Seven is one difficult to enunciate. We may call it the Path, the Way, or the Great Way of the Mind. Its foundation is a reflection and substantial summary of Archetypes One through Six. One may also see the Way of the Mind as showing the kingdom or fruits of appropriate travel through the mind in that the mind continues to move as majestically through the material it conceives of as a chariot drawn by royal lions or steeds." (79.41)

## Function in the Archetypical System

The Great Way of Mind is:
- **The environment**: The framework for mental evolution
- **A summary**: Reflects and summarizes Archetypes 1-6
- **The pathway**: The ongoing journey of mind
- **Progressive unveiling**: The veil is partially lifted but still present

### The Partially Lifted Veil

A key feature is that the veil is shown both lifted and present:

> "Thusly, the veil is shown both somewhat lifted and still present, since the work of mind and its transformation involves progressive lifting of the great veil betwixt conscious and deep minds. The complete success of this attempt is not properly a portion of third-density work and, more especially, third-density mental processes." (100.7)

### Polarity and the Veil

> "The fact that the veil is raised higher on the right-hand side than on the left indicates to me that the adept choosing the positive polarity will have greater success in penetrating the veil. Ra: This is a true statement if it is realized that the questioner speaks of potential success. Indeed, your third-density experience is distorted or skewed so that the positive orientation has more aid than the so-called negative." (100.8)

## Key Quotes from Ra

### On the Great Way as Environment
> "The Great Way of Mind, Body, or Spirit is intended to limn the milieu within which the work of mind, body, or spirit shall be placed." (100.7)

### On Majestic Movement
> "The mind continues to move as majestically through the material it conceives of as a chariot drawn by royal lions or steeds." (79.41)

### On the Sphinxes
> "The culturally determined creatures called sphinxes do not indicate mastery over catalyst. The second supposition, that of placing the creatures as the movers of the chariot of mind, has far more virtue. You may connote the concept of time to the image of the sphinx. The mental and mental/emotional complex ripens and moves and is transformed in time." (100.11)

### On Incomplete Success
> "The complete success of this attempt is not properly a portion of third-density work and, more especially, third-density mental processes." (100.7)

### On the Sword and Scepter
> "There is an overriding spiritual environment and protection for the environment of the mind... the negatively polarized adept will attempt to fashion that covenant for its own use whereas the positively polarized entity may hold forth that which is exemplified by the astrological sword; that is, light and truth." (100.13)

## Visual Symbolism Analysis

Based on Ra's discussion of the tarot image (sessions 79, 100):

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Chariot** | The vehicle of mind moving through experience |
| **Figure in chariot** | The self journeying through mental evolution |
| **Sphinxes/creatures** | Time, the movement and ripening of mind (100.11) |
| **Partially lifted veil** | Progressive unveiling, higher on right side |
| **Crown of three stars** | Astrological addition, may be released (100.10) |
| **Sword** | Light and truth for the positive adept |
| **Scepter** | Spiritual protection and covenant |
| **Curtain/veil** | The ongoing work of lifting the veil |

Ra's comments on the image:
- The crown of three stars is astrological and "may be released from its stricture" (100.10)
- The sphinxes connote time, not mastery (100.11)
- Sword and scepter positions are astrological but have relevance (100.13-100.14)

## Relationships

### Triad Relationship (Great Ways)
The Great Way of Mind relates to:
- **Great Way of Body (14)**: The environment of physical evolution, The Alchemist
- **Great Way of Spirit (21)**: The environment of spiritual evolution, The Adept/World

The Great Way of Mind is the mental environment; Great Way of Body is the physical environment; Great Way of Spirit is the spiritual environment. All three describe the milieu for their respective cycles.

### Pair Relationship (Transformation & Great Way)
The Transformation (6) and Great Way (7) form the culminating pair:
- Transformation is the change; Great Way is the context for change
- Transformation commits to a path; Great Way shows the journey
- Both together describe the dynamic movement of consciousness evolution

## Contemplation Prompts

1. **Your Mental Environment**: What is the "environment" within which your mental work takes place? What shapes your journey of mind?

2. **Progressive Unveiling**: The veil is partially lifted but still present. Where in your mental life have you lifted the veil? Where does mystery remain?

3. **The Chariot Journey**: Can you sense your mind "moving majestically" through experience? What drives your chariot - time, will, curiosity?

4. **Summary of the Cycle**: The Great Way summarizes Archetypes 1-6. How do Matrix, Potentiator, Catalyst, Experience, Significator, and Transformation all contribute to your mental journey?

5. **Incomplete Success**: Ra says complete success "is not properly a portion of third-density work." How does accepting this incompleteness change your approach to mental development?
