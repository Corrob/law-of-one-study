## Ra's Core Description

> "The Potentiator of the Mind is that great resource which may be seen as the sea into which the consciousness dips ever deeper and more thoroughly in order to create, ideate, and become more self-conscious." (79.20)

The Potentiator of Mind represents the **unconscious mind** - the vast hidden resource that consciousness draws upon but cannot directly access. It holds all the riches of the deep mind, waiting to be "courted" by the reaching conscious mind.

> "That which awaits the reaching may be seen as a female principle. The richness of the male and female system of polarity is interesting and we would not comment further but suggest consideration by the student." (92.20)

## Function in the Archetypical System

The Potentiator of Mind is:
- **The awaiting principle**: It does not reach but awaits the reaching
- **The female principle**: Receptive, containing hidden depths
- **The unconscious resource**: All that consciousness may draw upon
- **The veiled mystery**: Hidden behind the veil from conscious access

### The Veil Between Matrix and Potentiator

The veil between conscious and unconscious is the key innovation of this Logos:

> "Card #2, the Potentiator of the Mind: we see a female sitting on a rectangular block. She is veiled and between two pillars which seem to be identically covered with drawings but one much darker than the other. I am assuming that the veil represents the veil between the conscious and subconscious or Matrix and Potentiator. Is this correct? Ra: This is quite correct." (92.21)

## Key Quotes from Ra

### On the Nature of the Potentiator
> "The Potentiator of the Mind is the great sea of the subconscious mind. It awaits those who would seek its treasures." (92.14)

### On the Courtship Dynamic
> "Many use the trunk and roots of mind as if that portion of mind were a badly used, prostituted entity. Then this entity gains from this great storehouse that which is rough, prostituted, and without great virtue. Those who turn to the deep mind, seeing it in the guise of the maiden, go forth to court it. The courtship has nothing of plunder in its semblance and may be protracted, yet the treasure gained by such careful courtship is great." (99.8)

### On the Book of Secrets
> "The very nature of the feminine principle of mind which, in Ra's suggestion, was related specifically to what may be termed sanctified sexuality is, itself, without addition, the book which neither the feminine nor the male principle may use until the male principle has reached and penetrated, in a symbolically sexual fashion, the inner secrets of this feminine principle." (92.25)

### On the Two Pillars
> "The two pillars of light and darkness often symbolize the polarized nature of the illusion and the possibility of both paths being fed by the unconscious." (92.22)

## Visual Symbolism Analysis

Based on Ra's discussion of the tarot image (sessions 92, 96):

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Female figure** | The awaiting, receptive principle |
| **Veil** | The separation between conscious and unconscious |
| **Two pillars** | Light and dark paths, polarity available |
| **Seated position** | Stillness, awaiting |
| **Book/scroll** | Hidden knowledge, the "inner secrets" |
| **Rectangular seat** | Foundation, stability of the unconscious |
| **Crux ansata** | Ra suggested adding this symbol (96.17) |
| **Crown (optional)** | Astrological addition, may be kept or removed (96.18) |

Ra's corrections to the image:
- Add crux ansata at center of female form
- May keep or remove crown based on student's interpretation

## Relationships

### Triad Relationship (Potentiators)
The Potentiator of Mind relates to:
- **Potentiator of Body (9)**: "That which, being informed, regulates activity" (79.20)
- **Potentiator of Spirit (16)**: "The most sudden awakening, illuminating, and generative influence" (79.20)

While Potentiator of Mind is the sea of the unconscious, Potentiator of Body regulates, and Potentiator of Spirit illuminates suddenly.

### Pair Relationship (Matrix & Potentiator)
The Matrix (1) and Potentiator (2) form the fundamental pair:
- Matrix reaches; Potentiator awaits
- Matrix is male; Potentiator is female
- Matrix is conscious; Potentiator is unconscious
- The relationship is one of "courtship" not "plunder"

## Contemplation Prompts

1. **The Sea Within**: What does it feel like to sense the vast unconscious "sea" within you? How do you become aware of its presence?

2. **Courtship vs. Plunder**: Do you approach your unconscious with respect and patience (courtship) or with demands for immediate results (plunder)? What is the difference in outcome?

3. **The Veil**: What practices help you glimpse beyond the veil? Dreams, meditation, creativity? What do you find there?

4. **Two Pillars**: The Potentiator sits between light and dark pillars. How does your unconscious contain resources for both service-to-others and service-to-self paths?

5. **The Inner Book**: What "inner secrets" does your deep mind hold? What would it mean to "penetrate" these secrets through genuine seeking?
