## Ra's Core Description

The Transformation of Mind represents the **crucial change point** where consciousness must choose one approach to the deep mind and abandon another. Ra corrects a common misunderstanding:

> "Questioner: Let me ask... if the Lovers represent the merging of the conscious and the unconscious or a communication between conscious and unconscious? Ra: Again, without being at all unperceptive, you miss the heart of this particular archetype which may be more properly called the Transformation of the Mind." (79.39)

The key insight is that transformation requires **abandonment** of one principle:

> "The conscious entity holds both and will turn itself one way or the other or, potentially, backwards and forwards, rocking first one way then the other and not achieving the transformation. In order for the Transformation of Mind to occur, one principle governing the use of the deep mind must be abandoned." (100.6)

## Function in the Archetypical System

The Transformation of Mind is:
- **The change point**: Where actual transformation occurs
- **A choice between approaches**: Not just awareness, but commitment
- **Abandonment of one principle**: Cannot serve both approaches
- **Beyond rocking back and forth**: Commitment, not vacillation

### Two Approaches to the Deep Mind

The two females in the image represent two ways of relating to the unconscious:

> "Those who turn to the deep mind, seeing it in the guise of the maiden, go forth to court it. The courtship has nothing of plunder in its semblance and may be protracted, yet the treasure gained by such careful courtship is great." (99.8)

> "Many use the trunk and roots of mind as if that portion of mind were a badly used, prostituted entity. Then this entity gains from this great storehouse that which is rough, prostituted, and without great virtue." (99.8)

## Key Quotes from Ra

### On the Crossed Arms
> "Let us examine the crossed arms of the male who is to be transformed. What, O student, do you make of the crossing? What see you in this tangle? There is a creative point to be found in this element which was not discussed overmuch by the questioner." (99.8)

### On the Pull of Both Paths
> "In this image of Transformation of Mind, then, each of the females points the way it would go, but is not able to move, nor are the two female entities striving to do so. They are at rest. The conscious entity holds both and will turn itself one way or the other." (100.6)

### On the Triangle Symbolism
> "It is to be noted that the triangular shape formed by the shoulders and crossed elbows of consciousness is a shape to be associated with transformation. Indeed, you may see this shape echoed twice more in the image, each echo having its own riches to add to the impact of this complex of concepts." (100.6)

### On the Arrow/Creature Above
> "This arrow is not the arrow which kills but rather that which, in its own way, protects. Those who choose separation, that being the quality most indicative of the left-hand path, are protected from other-selves by a strength and sharpness equivalent to the degree of transformation which the mind has experienced in the negative sense." (99.8)

## Visual Symbolism Analysis

Based on Ra's discussion of the tarot image (sessions 79, 99, 100):

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Male figure (center)** | The conscious self facing transformation |
| **Crossed arms** | The "tangle" of choice, creative tension |
| **Two females** | Two approaches to the unconscious (courtship vs. plunder) |
| **Triangle shape** | Transformation symbol, appears three times |
| **Figure above with arrow** | Protection on the left-hand path; not killing but protecting through separation |
| **Female on right (clothed)** | The virginal, respected approach to deep mind |
| **Female on left (less clothed)** | The prostituted, plundering approach |

Key insight: The females do not move or strive - the choice and movement must come from the conscious self.

## Relationships

### Triad Relationship (Transformations)
The Transformation of Mind relates to:
- **Transformation of Body (13)**: Physical transformation, Death - release of the old form
- **Transformation of Spirit (20)**: Spiritual transformation, Judgement - the call to new being

Mental transformation is choosing an approach; physical transformation is releasing form; spiritual transformation is answering the call.

### Pair Relationship (Transformation & Great Way)
The Transformation (6) and Great Way (7) form a pair:
- Transformation is the change point; Great Way is the environment for that change
- Transformation commits to a path; Great Way shows the journey on that path
- They work together as the culminating dynamics of each cycle

## Contemplation Prompts

1. **The Tangle**: What "tangle" do you experience when facing transformation? What are you holding onto with crossed arms?

2. **Rocking Back and Forth**: In what areas of life do you rock between approaches without committing? What prevents transformation?

3. **Courtship vs. Plunder**: How do you approach your unconscious mind? With patient courtship or demanding plunder? What results have you experienced?

4. **What Must Be Abandoned**: For transformation to occur, "one principle must be abandoned." What principle might you need to let go of?

5. **The Arrow of Protection**: Ra says the left-hand path is "protected" by separation. How does separation both protect and isolate?
