## Ra's Core Description

The Significator represents the **complex itself** - the spirit as both actor and acted upon. While Ra did not provide specific analysis of this archetype, the Significator of Spirit would represent the spiritual self in its totality.

The Sun card traditionally represents full illumination - suggesting that the spiritual self, when fully realized, radiates light.

## Function in the Archetypical System

The Significator of Spirit is:
- **The spiritual self**: The spirit as entity, actor, and recipient
- **Made complex by the veil**: Gained layers of meaning after veiling
- **Full illumination**: The Sun suggests the realized spiritual being
- **Radiance**: The spirit that has come through darkness (Moon) to light

### The Sun's Teaching

Following the Moon's dark night, the Sun represents:
- Clarity after confusion
- Direct light after reflected light
- The spiritual self fully realized
- Radiance that blesses all around it

The Significator of Spirit, as The Sun, suggests that the spiritual self at its fullest is radiant, clear, and life-giving.

## Key Quotes from Ra

### On the Pre-Veil Significator
> "The Significator of each mind, body, and spirit may be seen as a simple and unified concept." (79.20)

### On Significator Generally
> "The Significator could no longer be seen as simply the self, but rather as that self modified by the interrelationship of the conscious with the unconscious." (79.36)

**Note**: Ra did not provide detailed analysis of this specific archetype comparable to the Significator of Mind (Archetype 5).

## Visual Symbolism Analysis

The traditional tarot image (The Sun) shows themes of spiritual fulfillment:

| Symbol | Possible Meaning |
|--------|------------------|
| **Sun** | Full illumination, direct spiritual light |
| **Child/children** | Innocence, joy, new birth |
| **Garden/flowers** | The fruits of spiritual work |
| **White horse** | Purified will, spiritual power |
| **Wall** | Boundary transcended or defined |
| **Rays** | Radiance extending to all |

*Note: Ra did not specifically analyze this image as was done for the Mind cycle cards.*

## Relationships

### Triad Relationship (Significators)
The Significator of Spirit relates to:
- **Significator of Mind (5)**: The Hierophant - bounded, willing, questioning
- **Significator of Body (12)**: The Hanged Man - suspended, patient, surrendered

Mind's Significator is bounded; Body's is suspended; Spirit's is radiant. Each shows the complex self in its respective domain.

### Pair Relationship (Significator & Choice)
All three Significators (5, 12, 19) are eventually paired with The Choice (22):
- The Significator is the self that makes the Choice
- The spiritual Significator represents the highest aspect of the choosing self
- Full spiritual realization illuminates the Choice

## Contemplation Prompts

2. **After the Dark Night**: The Sun follows the Moon. After spiritual darkness, what clarity emerged?

3. **Simplicity Regained**: The Sun often shows children - innocence and simplicity. How does spiritual maturity return us to a new simplicity?

4. **Giving Light**: The Sun gives light freely to all. How does your spiritual self radiate to others?

5. **The Complex Self**: Before the veil, the Significator was simple. How has your spiritual self become complex? How might it return to unified radiance?
