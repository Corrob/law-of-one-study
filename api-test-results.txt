Test 1: RETRIEVE+CURIOUS+SURFACE
Query: What did Ra say about wanderers?
Expected: RETRIEVE + CURIOUS + SURFACE
Response (first 2000 chars):
event: meta
data: {"quotes":[{"text":"Questioner: Are there any Wanderers with these Elder Race, or not? Ra: I am Ra. These are planetary entities harvested — Wanderers only in the sense that they chose, in fourth-density love, to immediately reincarnate in third density rather than proceeding towards fourth density. This causes them to be Wanderers of a type, Wanderers who have never left the Earth plane because of their free will rather than because of their vibrational level.","reference":"Ra 15.20","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/15#20"},{"text":"Questioner: Then from what you say I am guessing that these Wanderers returned or wandered to Ra’s third density to possibly seed greater wisdom into what they saw as an overabundance of compassion in the Ra culture. Is this correct? Ra: I am Ra. This is incorrect in the sense that before incarnation it was the desire of the Wanderers only to aid in service to others. The query has correctness when seen from the viewpoint of the Wanderers within that incarnation.","reference":"Ra 89.38","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/89#38"},{"text":"Questioner: [Is it] possible for you to tell us if any of the three of us are and have been Wanderers? Ra: I am Ra. In scanning each of the mind/body/spirit complexes present, we find an already complete assurance of this occurrence and, therefore, find no harm in recapitulating this occurrence. Each of those present are Wanderers pursuing a mission, if you will.","reference":"Ra 12.32","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/12#32"},{"text":"Questioner: Can you tell me if a large percentage of the Wanderers here now are those of Ra? Ra: I am Ra. I can.","reference":"Ra 45.3","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/45#3"},{"text":"Questioner: Have there been any Wanderers on this planet for the past 50,000 years now? Ra: I am Ra. There have been a few. There have been many more which chose to join this last cycle of 25,000 years and many, many more which have come for harvest.","reference":"Ra 70.16","url

Test 2: UNDERSTAND+SURFACE
Query: What are densities?
Expected: UNDERSTAND + CURIOUS + SURFACE
Response (first 2000 chars):
event: meta
data: {"quotes":[{"text":"Questioner: Could you define the word density as we have been using it to give us a little greater idea of the concept of this term when used by you? Ra: I am Ra. The term density is a, what you would call, mathematical one. The closest analogy is that of music, whereby after seven notes on your western type of scale, if you will, the eighth note begins a new octave. Within your great octave of existence which we share with you, there are seven octaves or densities. Within each density there are seven sub-densities. Within each sub-density, seven sub-sub-densities, and so on infinitely.","reference":"Ra 16.51","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/16#51"},{"text":"Questioner: You stated that each archetype is a concept complex. Would you please define what you mean by that statement? Ra: I am Ra. Upon the face of it such a definition is without merit, being circular. A concept complex is a complex of concepts just as a molecule is a complex structure made up of more than one type of energy nexus or atom. Each atom within a molecule is its unique identity and, by some means, can be removed from the molecule. The molecule of water can, by chemical means, be caused to separate into hydrogen and oxygen. Separately they cannot be construed to equal water. When formed in the molecular structure which exemplifies water the two are irrefragably* water.Just in this way each archetype has within it several root atoms of organizational being. Separately the overall structure of the complex cannot be seen. Together the concept complex is irrefragably one thing. However, just as it is most useful in grasping the potentials in your physical systems of the constituting nature of water, so in grasping the nature of an archetype it is useful to have a sense of its component concepts.","reference":"Ra 89.20","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/89#20"},{"text":"Questioner: Then I am assuming this is the most effective density for this work. Would this density

Test 3: UNDERSTAND+INTERMEDIATE
Query: How does polarity relate to harvest?
Expected: UNDERSTAND + CURIOUS + INTERMEDIATE
Response (first 2000 chars):
event: meta
data: {"quotes":[{"text":"Questioner: I have several different questions. In this session I hope to establish, by searching around with several different types of questions, a point of entry into an investigation that will be fruitful. I would first ask is it possible to increase polarity without increasing harvestability? Ra: I am Ra. The connection between polarization and harvestability is most important in third-density harvest. In this density an increase in the serving of others or the serving of self will almost inevitably increase the ability of an entity to enjoy an higher intensity of light. Thus in this density, we may say, it is hardly possible to polarize without increasing in harvestability.","reference":"Ra 71.2","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/71#2"},{"text":"Questioner: How common in the universe is a mixed harvest for a planet of both positively and negatively oriented mind/body/spirit complexes? Ra: I am Ra. Among planetary harvests which yield an harvest of mind/body/spirit complexes approximately 10% are negative; approximately 60% are positive; and approximately 30% are mixed with nearly all harvest being positive. In the event of mixed harvest it is almost unknown for the majority of the harvest to be negative. When a planet moves strongly towards the negative there is almost no opportunity for harvestable positive polarization.","reference":"Ra 65.13","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/65#13"},{"text":"Questioner: Would this be the reason for the greater positive harvests? I suspect that it isn’t, but would there be Logoi that have greater negative percentage harvests because of this type of biasing? Ra: I am Ra. No. There have been Logoi with greater percentages of negative harvests. However, the biasing mechanisms cannot change the requirements for achieving harvestability either in the positive or in the negative sense. There are Logoi which have offered a neutral background against which to polarize.  This Logos chose not to do s

Test 4: UNDERSTAND+CHALLENGING
Query: Ra's concept of free will seems to contradict predestination. How do you reconcile this?
Expected: UNDERSTAND + CHALLENGING + INTERMEDIATE
Response (first 2000 chars):
event: meta
data: {"quotes":[{"text":"Questioner: I guess, under the first distortion, it was the free will of the Logos to choose to evolve without free will. Is this correct? Ra: I am Ra. This is correct.","reference":"Ra 77.18","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/77#18"},{"text":"Questioner: These two types of entities seem to be incompatible, you might say, with each other. I don’t know. Can you tell me the reason behind both types of entities inhabiting the same space/time? Ra: I am Ra. Consider the workings of free will as applied to evolution. There are paths that the mind/body complex follows in an attempt to survive, to reproduce, and to seek in its fashion that which is unconsciously felt as the potential for growth; these two arenas or paths of development being two among many.","reference":"Ra 30.7","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/30#7"},{"text":"Questioner: I was wondering if there was some principle behind the fact that a sexual union does not necessarily lead to fertilization. I’m not interested in the chemical or physical principles of it. I’m interested in whether or not there is some metaphysical principle that leads to the couple having a child or not, or is it purely random? Ra: I am Ra. This is random within certain limits. If an entity has reached the seniority whereby it chooses the basic structure of the life experience, this entity may then choose to incarnate in a physical complex which is not capable of reproduction. Thus we find some entities which have chosen to be unfertile. Other entities, through free will, make use of various devices to insure nonfertility. Except for these conditions, the condition is random.","reference":"Ra 31.6","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/31#6"},{"text":"Questioner: In that case my higher self would, shall we say, have a very large advantage in knowing precisely what was needed since it would know what… as far as I am concerned, what was going to happen. Is this correct? Ra: I am Ra. This is incorrect, in t

Test 5: APPLY+PROCESSING+SURFACE
Query: I'm struggling to forgive my father
Expected: APPLY + PROCESSING + SURFACE
Response (first 2000 chars):
event: meta
data: {"quotes":[{"text":"Questioner: You stated yesterday that forgiveness is the eradicator of karma. I am assuming that balanced forgiveness for the full eradication of karma would require forgiveness not only of other-selves but forgiveness of self. Am I correct? Ra: I am Ra. You are correct. We will briefly expand upon this understanding in order to clarify.Forgiveness of other-self is forgiveness of self. An understanding of this insists upon full forgiveness upon the conscious level of self and other-self, for they are one. A full forgiveness is thus impossible without the inclusion of self.","reference":"Ra 18.12","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/18#12"},{"text":"Questioner: If an entity develops what is called a karma in an incarnation, is there then programming that sometimes occurs so that he will experience catalyst that will enable him to get to a point of forgiveness thereby alleviating the karma? Ra: I am Ra. This is, in general, correct. However, both self and any involved other-self may, at any time through the process of understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness, ameliorate these patterns. This is true at any point in an incarnative pattern. Thus one who has set in motion an action may forgive itself and never again make that error. This also brakes or stops what you call karma.","reference":"Ra 34.5","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/34#5"},{"text":"Questioner: Is the process in positive time/space identical with the process in negative time/space for this healing? Ra: I am Ra. The process in space/time of the forgiveness and acceptance is much like that in time/space in that the qualities of the process are analogous. However, while in space/time it is not possible to determine the course of events beyond the incarnation but only to correct present imbalances. In time/space, upon the other hand, it is not possible to correct any unbalanced actions but rather to perceive the imbalances and thusly forgive the self for that which is.The deci

Test 7: APPLY+CURIOUS
Query: How can I use Ra's teachings about catalyst in meditation?
Expected: APPLY + CURIOUS + INTERMEDIATE
Response (first 2000 chars):
event: meta
data: {"quotes":[{"text":"Questioner: I would like, if possible, an example of the activity we call Catalyst of the Mind in a particular individual undergoing this process.  Could Ra give an example of that? Ra: I am Ra. All that assaults your senses is catalyst. We, in speaking to this support group through this instrument, offer catalyst. The configurations of each in the group of body offer catalyst through comfort/discomfort. In fact all that is unprocessed that has come before the notice of a mind/body/spirit complex is catalyst.","reference":"Ra 93.11","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/93#11"},{"text":"Questioner: What is the plan for use of the catalyst of cancer? Ra: I am Ra. The catalyst, and all catalyst, is designed to offer experience. This experience in your density may be loved and accepted or it may be controlled. These are the two paths. When neither path is chosen the catalyst fails in its design and the entity proceeds until catalyst strikes it which causes it to form a bias towards acceptance and love or separation and control. There is no lack of space/time in which this catalyst may work.","reference":"Ra 46.16","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/46#16"},{"text":"Questioner: Thank you. Can you give me examples of catalytic action to produce learning under each of the following headings from the last session we had… Can you give me an example of the self unmanifested producing learning catalyst? Ra: I am Ra. We observed your interest in the catalyst of pain. This experience is most common among your entities. The pain may be of the physical complex. More often it is of the mental and emotional complex. In some few cases the pain is spiritual in complex-nature. This creates a potential for learning. The lessons to be learned vary. Almost always these lessons include patience, tolerance, and the ability for the light touch.Very often the catalyst for emotional pain, whether it be the death of the physical complex of one other-self which is l

Test 8: RETRIEVE+SEEKING_VALIDATION
Query: I remember Ra saying wanderers chose to help with harvest. Can you find that quote?
Expected: RETRIEVE + SEEKING_VALIDATION + INTERMEDIATE
Response (first 2000 chars):
event: meta
data: {"quotes":[{"text":"Questioner: Have there been any Wanderers on this planet for the past 50,000 years now? Ra: I am Ra. There have been a few. There have been many more which chose to join this last cycle of 25,000 years and many, many more which have come for harvest.","reference":"Ra 70.16","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/70#16"},{"text":"Questioner: Well, I would just include the question as to why time of harvest is selected by so many Wanderers as time for incarnation? Ra: I am Ra. There are several reasons for incarnation during harvest. They may be divided by the terms self and other-self.The overriding reason for the offering of these Brothers and Sisters of Sorrow in incarnative states is the possibility of aiding other-selves by the lightening of the planetary consciousness distortions and the probability of offering catalyst to other-selves which will increase the harvest.There are two other reasons for choosing this service which have to do with the self.The Wanderer, if it remembers and dedicates itself to service, will polarize much more rapidly than is possible in the far more etiolated* realms of higher-density catalyst.The final reason is within the mind/body/spirit totality or the social memory complex totality which may judge that an entity or members of a societal entity can make use of third-density catalyst to recapitulate a learning/teaching which is adjudged to be less than perfectly balanced. This especially applies to those entering into and proceeding through sixth density wherein the balance between compassion and wisdom is perfected.","reference":"Ra 52.9","url":"https://lawofone.info/s/52#9"},{"text":"Questioner: And if a Wanderer were to be successfully infringed upon, shall I say, by the Orion group, what would happen to this Wanderer at the harvest? Ra: I am Ra. If the Wanderer entity demonstrated through action a negative orientation towards other-selves it would be as we have said before, caught into the planetary
