She doesn't know if it will succeed. She can't prove it's the right choice. Her family thinks she's foolish.\n\n**If there were no veil:** Sarah would simply know that all paths lead to the Creator, that security and risk are equally illusory, and that her soul planned this choice before birth. With such certainty, the choice would carry no weight. She might make it casually—or not bother, knowing all outcomes are equally valid.\n\n**With the veil:** Sarah must choose in darkness. She feels the pull toward service but cannot prove it's right. She must trust something she cannot see. She must exercise will despite uncertainty. She must have faith.\n\nThis is exactly what the veil was designed to create. Sarah's choice—to follow love into uncertainty—develops her faith and will far more powerfully than any amount of certain knowing could. The fear is real. The doubt is real. And so is her choice to act anyway.\n\nIf she stays in the stable job, she hasn't failed—she's simply delayed. The catalyst will return, perhaps in another form. The veil ensures she'll keep getting opportunities until she makes the choice her deeper self intended.\n\nThe forgetting isn't cruel. It's the condition that makes her choice meaningful."
