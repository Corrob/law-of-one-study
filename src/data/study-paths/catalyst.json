Frustration rises: tension in your jaw, grip tightening on the steering wheel, thoughts racing about wasted time.\n\n**Using catalyst unconsciously:** You stew in frustration, honk at other cars, arrive home irritable, and snap at a family member. The catalyst is wasted—or worse, creates new catalyst.\n\n**Using catalyst consciously (positive path):** You notice the frustration arising. Rather than suppressing it or acting on it, you breathe and allow yourself to fully feel it. You observe: 'This is frustration. It feels like heat in my chest, tension in my hands.' You don't judge it as bad—it simply is.\n\nLater, in your evening balancing meditation, you recall the moment. You re-experience the frustration fully. Then you allow its opposite—patience, acceptance, even gratitude for the pause—to arise. You feel both poles. You rest in the center between them.\n\nThe next time traffic stalls, you notice: the charge is less. The frustration arises but doesn't grip you as tightly. Gradually, traffic becomes just another situation—an opportunity to be present, to practice patience, or simply to rest.\n\nThis is the work. Not dramatic transformation overnight, but gradual freedom from reactivity, one moment of catalyst at a time."
