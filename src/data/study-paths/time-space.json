In that life, Michael was often harsh and critical toward his family, believing he was helping them 'toughen up.' He ignored many opportunities for tenderness.\n\n**In time/space (the between-life state):**\n\nMichael now sees his life in full. Not just his actions, but their effects—the pain his children felt, the distance his wife experienced, the love he could have given but withheld. He sees it all simultaneously, without the veil's protection. It's overwhelming, but there is no judgment from outside—only his own growing understanding.\n\nGuides help him process. He reviews specific moments: the time his daughter showed him her artwork and he criticized it, when he might have praised. The time his wife reached for his hand and he pulled away. He feels both sides now—what he felt, what they felt.\n\nSelf-forgiveness comes slowly. He sees that his harshness came from his own fear, his own pain from childhood. He wasn't evil—he was wounded and unknowing. He forgives the child he was, the man he became.\n\nBut here's the crucial insight: **he cannot change any of it from time/space**. He can see, understand, forgive—but not act differently. The moments are complete.\n\n**Planning the next incarnation:**\n\nWorking with his Higher Self and guides, Michael plans circumstances for his next life that will offer opportunities to learn tenderness: perhaps a sensitive child who will require gentleness, or a partner whose love language is words of affirmation. The catalyst will be precisely calibrated.\n\nThen Michael returns to space/time—forgetting all of this, facing the same patterns without memory, armed only with a subtle inclination toward what he came to learn.\n\nThis is why incarnation matters. This is why the darkness serves. In the next life, when Michael faces the choice—criticism or compassion—he can actually choose differently. That choice, made 'by candlelight,' transforms his being in ways that clear sight alone never could."
