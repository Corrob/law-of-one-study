      "markdown": "## Image Analysis\n\n*Ra did not provide detailed imagery analysis for Spirit archetypes as was done for Mind. The following interprets the Egyptian tarot image using Ra's established patterns.*\n\nThe image shows an **angel with trumpet** above figures rising from a sarcophagus:\n\n**The Angel with Trumpet** - A winged figure descends from above, blowing a trumpet. This is the call - not internal motivation but external summons. Spiritual transformation responds to a call from beyond the ordinary self.\n\n**The Rising Figures** - Three figures (perhaps representing body, mind, and spirit) rise from what appears to be a sarcophagus or tomb. They respond to the trumpet's call by rising. The old state (death, burial, stasis) is left behind.\n\n**The Sarcophagus/Tomb** - The structure from which figures rise represents the old self, the previous spiritual state. Transformation requires leaving this behind - one cannot rise while remaining in the grave.\n\n**The Upward Movement** - All motion is upward, toward the angel. Spiritual transformation elevates, draws upward, calls toward higher states.\n\n**The Symbol Below** - At the bottom, a symbol appears (circle with lines), suggesting that this transformation has cosmic or archetypal significance. The call to resurrection is not arbitrary but follows eternal patterns."

      "markdown": "### Triad Insight\n\nThe three Transformations require different things:\n\n| Transformation | Requirement | Character |\n|----------------|------------|----------|\n| Mind (6) | Choosing between approaches | Two Paths diverging |\n| Body (13) | Death of old form | Reaper in the field |\n| Spirit (20) | Answering the call | Angel's trumpet, rising figures |\n\nMind's Transformation requires choice between principles. Body's Transformation requires release - the death of what was. Spirit's Transformation requires response to a call from beyond.\n\n### Pair Relationship\n\nTransformation (20) and Great Way (21) form the culminating pair:\n\n- **Transformation** = The call to resurrection, leaving the tomb\n- **Great Way** = The cosmic environment in which the Adept dances\n\nThe call precedes the dance. After resurrection, the Adept enters the Great Way's cosmic harmony."

      "markdown": "### Answering the Call\n\nSpiritual transformation differs from mental and physical:\n\n- **Mind (6)** - The self chooses (Two Paths)\n- **Body (13)** - Death happens naturally (each moment, each day)\n- **Spirit (20)** - A call comes that must be answered\n\nThe angel's trumpet suggests that spiritual transformation involves something beyond self-initiation. One does not simply decide to be spiritually reborn - one is *called* and must *respond*. The rising figures show what response looks like: leaving the tomb, moving upward toward the source of the call.\n\nThis connects to Ra's emphasis on the \"calling\" in spiritual work - the self opens to influence from beyond and responds."

      "markdown": "### When to Embody the Transformation of Spirit\n\n- When something beyond your ordinary will summons you through beauty, suffering, longing, or sudden knowing\n- When your old spiritual identity feels complete but confining\n- When you sense an upward pull toward something greater than your current understanding\n- When the call to transform arrives and demands a response\n\n### How to Embody It\n\n1. Listen for the call. Spiritual transformation involves something beyond self-initiation, and the trumpet sounds through beauty, suffering, longing, or sudden knowing\n2. Be willing to leave the tomb. Answering the call means releasing your old spiritual identity, even when it felt safe and complete\n3. Respond with your whole being. Three figures rise together, suggesting body, mind, and spirit all participate in spiritual resurrection\n4. Allow resurrection. You cannot force it, but you can prevent it by refusing to rise. When the call comes, the work is simply to say yes\n\nAll motion in this image moves toward the angel. When you feel drawn toward something greater, that draw may be the trumpet's call. Trust the upward movement."
