Ra calls it \"the axis upon which the creation turns.\"\n\n**Why study The Choice first?** Because all 21 other archetypes serve to bring consciousness toward this fundamental decision. Understanding The Choice illuminates the purpose of the entire system.\n\n![The Choice](/images/tarot/tarot22.jpg)\n\nIn traditional tarot numbering, this position corresponds to what is often called \"The Fool.\" However, Ra names this archetype simply \"The Choice\" - a far more precise description of its function. Ra's conception should not be confused with traditional Fool interpretations."

The self that wills, acts, and connects is the self that chooses."
