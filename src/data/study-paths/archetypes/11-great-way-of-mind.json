The Great Way of Mind, Body, or Spirit is intended to limn the milieu within which the work of mind, body, or spirit shall be placed. Thusly, the veil is shown both somewhat lifted and still present, since the work of mind and its transformation involves progressive lifting of the great veil betwixt conscious and deep minds.

See the environment, not just the events. Notice the overall quality of your inner landscape, the milieu through which your mental evolution unfolds\n2. Trust the sphinxes of time. Mental evolution \"ripens and moves and is transformed in time,\" and patient persistence matters more than dramatic breakthroughs\n3. Notice the veil lifting. Moments of clarity, insight, or connection are the progressive lifting Ra describes, and these glimpses are real\n4. Accept the ongoing journey. The chariot continues to move through all it conceives, and there is no final arrival in third density\n\nRa confirms \"this Logos has a bias towards kindness\" (90.21). The positive path has more aid in penetrating the veil. This is encouragement for the majestic, continuing journey."
