Compare with Mind's Significator (\"actor possessed of free will\" - 79.42) and Body's Significator (\"creature of the mind and instrument of manifestation\" - 81.14). Each Significator has its own essential character.\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\n- **Full illumination** - After the Moon's partial, reflected light comes the Sun's direct radiance\n- **Realized self** - The spiritual Significator shows the self in its fullest expression\n- **Giving light** - The Sun radiates to all without discrimination\n- **Pairs with The Choice** - Like all Significators, connects to the fundamental polarity decision"

      "markdown": "## Image Analysis\n\n*Ra did not provide detailed imagery analysis for Spirit archetypes as was done for Mind. The following interprets the Egyptian tarot image using Ra's established patterns.*\n\nThe image shows the **radiant Sun** above two figures holding hands within a wreath:\n\n**The Great Sun** - At the top, a radiating sun with ornate projections shines without obscuration. Unlike the Moon's filtered, uncertain light, the Sun gives fully and directly. A small figure (possibly Horus or the spiritual child) appears within - the realized self born of spiritual work.\n\n**The Two Figures** - Below the Sun, a male figure (wearing Egyptian royal attire with crescent moon) and female figure hold hands. They represent the union of polarities - male/female, conscious/unconscious, active/receptive - integrated in the light of spiritual realization.\n\n**The Male Figure's Crescent** - The male wears a crescent moon symbol, suggesting that the Moon's dark night has been integrated, not abandoned. The darkness is now worn as wisdom, not suffered as trial.\n\n**The Wreath** - The figures stand within a circular wreath of plants, suggesting completion, wholeness, the cycle fulfilled. This connects to the Great Way's cosmic wreath to come.\n\n**The Faces Below** - At the bottom, many faces/figures appear, suggesting all those illuminated by the spiritual self's radiance. The Sun shines on all."

Body's Significator shows the physical self in willing suspension. Spirit's Significator shows the awakened self radiating light freely.\n\n### Pairing with The Choice\n\nAll Significators pair with Archetype 22 (The Choice/The World). The Significator of Spirit specifically:\n\n- **The Choice** = The ultimate polarity decision (service to self or service to others)\n- **Significator of Spirit** = The radiant self that illuminates that choice\n\nThe Sun's light reveals The Choice clearly. The radiant spiritual self makes the fundamental decision visible to self and others."

This is not naive brightness but illumination that has passed through and integrated the darkness."

      "markdown": "### When to Embody the Significator of Spirit\n\n- When you notice yourself withholding warmth, presence, or light from others\n- When inner division (thinking versus feeling, action versus stillness) fragments your spiritual life\n- When you need to integrate your dark night experiences rather than reject them\n- When the moment calls for choosing to radiate rather than absorb\n\n### How to Embody It\n\n1. Choose to radiate. Ra says the Significator \"radiates or absorbs.\" In each moment, notice whether you offer light outward or draw it inward for yourself\n2. Integrate your darkness. The male figure wears the Moon's crescent, and true radiance does not reject the dark night but wears it as wisdom\n3. Unite your polarities. Where you find inner division, the Sun invites you to hold hands between the opposing aspects of yourself\n4. Shine without discrimination. The Sun gives light to all, so notice where you selectively withhold your warmth\n\nThe Significator pairs with The Choice. Your growing clarity of spiritual self reveals more clearly what you are choosing, moment by moment, in the great polarity decision."
