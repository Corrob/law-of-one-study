The conscious reaching male is potentiated by the awaiting female."

Court the unconscious through patience. Meditation, dream work, and contemplation invite the Priestess to share her book, while demanding results yields only \"rough material\"\n2. Attend to symbols and subtlety. The unconscious speaks through images, feelings, and synchronicities rather than direct statements\n3. Respect the veil. The separation between conscious and unconscious exists \"not by choice but by careful design,\" so work with it rather than trying to tear it away\n4. Allow fertility its protection. Ra says \"to bear fruit is a protected activity.\" Trust that what is gestating in the depths will emerge in its own time\n\nThe Potentiator awaits but does not force itself upon you. As Ra teaches, those who approach the deep mind \"in the guise of the maiden, go forth to court it,\" and \"the treasure gained by such careful courtship is great.\""
