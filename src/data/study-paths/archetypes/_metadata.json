  "completionReflection": "You have explored the architecture of the archetypical mind: the three cycles of Mind, Body, and Spirit, each with its seven stages from Matrix to Great Way, all culminating in The Choice. Remember Ra's guidance that this system is a resource for developing faith and will, not an end in itself. The archetypes serve to illuminate the \"stunning mystery of the One Infinite Creator.\" As you continue your journey, may you find these concepts useful tools for conscious evolution, always returning from inward study to behold \"the glory, the might, the majesty, the mystery, and the peace of oneness.\""
