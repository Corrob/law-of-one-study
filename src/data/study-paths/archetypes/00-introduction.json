It represents the Logos's blueprint for how consciousness evolves - a map of the deep mind that underlies all experience in third density.\n\nThis study path explores the 22 archetypes that Ra taught to the Egyptians, which later became the foundation of the tarot's Major Arcana. However, Ra's interpretation differs significantly from traditional tarot meanings. Here, we study them as tools for understanding the architecture of consciousness itself."

      "markdown": "The tarot originated not in Egypt but on Venus, Ra's home planet. During their third-density experience, Ra's people developed this system over many generations as a training tool for developing what they call the \"magical personality.\" When Ra later came to Egypt, they taught this system to priests who created the visual images we now associate with tarot.\n\n**Important**: The Minor Arcana and Court cards are NOT part of Ra's teaching - they were later additions from Chaldean and Sumerian influence. Only the 22 Major Arcana represent Ra's archetypical system.\n\nRa also cautions that the tarot images have accumulated distortions over time, including astrological influences and cultural mythology. Ra recommends working with the least distorted versions of the images and reminds us that \"those concept complexes which are the Major Arcana have no rightful place in divination but, rather, are tools for the further knowledge of the self by the self\" (88.23)."

As we have noted the third-density experience of those of Venus dealt far more deeply and harmoniously with what you would call relationships with other-selves, sexual energy transfer work, and philosophical or metaphysical research. The product of many, many generations of work upon what we conceived to be the archetypical mind produced the tarot which was used by our peoples as a training aid in developing the magical personality.",

But *conscious* study becomes most fruitful after substantial inner work.\n\nIf you're newer to this path, this study can still be valuable as intellectual understanding that will deepen as your energy work progresses."

The archetypical mind does not resolve any paradox or bring all into unity. This is not the property of any resource which is of the third density. Therefore, may we ask the student to look up from inward working and behold the glory, the might, the majesty, the mystery, and the peace of oneness. Let no consideration of bird or beast, darkness or light, shape or shadow keep any which seeks from the central consideration of unity.\n\nWe are not messengers of the complex. We bring the message of unity. In this perspective only may we affirm the value to the seeker of adepthood of the grasping, articulating, and use of this resource of the deep mind exemplified by the concept complexes of the archetypes.",
