The right-hand path seeks unity; the left-hand path strengthens separation.\n\n## Triad: The Three Transformations\n\n| Transformation | Characteristic | Symbol |\n|----------------|----------------|--------|\n| Mind (6) | Choosing between approaches to the unconscious | The Lovers |\n| Body (13) | Death/release of the old form | Death |\n| Spirit (20) | Answering the call to new being | Judgement |\n\nIn Mind, transformation is a choice between principles. In Body, transformation is death of the old. In Spirit, transformation is resurrection into the new."

Recognize the crossroads. Whenever you choose between trust and manipulation, openness and control, you stand at the Two Paths\n2. Choose courtship over plunder. Patient engagement yields \"great treasure\" while demanding results yields \"rough material\"\n3. Abandon one principle. Transformation requires letting go, and you cannot simultaneously court and plunder the unconscious\n4. Let the images haunt you. Ra says these images \"haunt rather than explicate,\" so sit with the archetype through contemplation, not comprehension alone\n\nThose on the right-hand path have \"no protection from other-selves.\" Choosing openness means accepting vulnerability as the price of deeper connection."
