The complexities of mind were evolved rather than the simple melding of experience from Potentiator to Matrix. The mind itself became an actor possessed of free will and, more especially, will. As the Significator of the mind, the Hierophant has the will to know, but what shall it do with its knowledge, and for what reasons does it seek?",

Remember that thoughts cannot walk. Ideas, intentions, and realizations remain potential until spoken or enacted through the body\n2. Observe your hands. One offers light outward (service to others), the other absorbs for self alone. Notice which gesture you are making in daily choices\n3. Engage your will. You are \"possessed of free will and, more especially, will,\" an active agent who chooses how to seek\n4. Trust the covenant. Spirit's outstretched wings draw the caged mind onward, even when bounded by material limitation\n\nYou are the Significator, the whole complex self, actor and acted upon. This archetype is not something external to study but something you already are."
